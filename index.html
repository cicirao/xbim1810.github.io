   Hello, everybody, my name is Bing Xue. Before my arrival in Chicago
 this summer, I was living in a middle-sized Chinese central city
 called Hefei, which is located near Yellow Mountain, the most famous
 scenic spot in China. Welcome all of you to my hometown.
        </p>
        <p>
   Graduated from <a href="http://www.hfbz.com/">Hefei No.8 Senior High School</a>, I accomplished my
 undergraduate program of biotechnology in <a href="http://www.ahu.edu.cn/">Anhui University</a> and then
 pursued a further master degree of English literature. The studies
 enabled me to enjoy the amazing beauty of natural creatures, rhyme
 and rhetoric of English poems and proses, as well as excellent
 narratives in novels.
        </p>
        <p>
   After graduation, I began my professional career as a Chinese-English
 translator in <a href="http://www.hcrdi.com/">HCRDI of CNBM</a>, the state-owned building
 material corporation which has many projects established abroad.
 Because of my duty, I went to a couple of countries and had several
 periods of bitter-sweet working experiences there abroad. I am
 greatly impressed on Vietnam's sweet fruits, Sudan's primitive
 culture, Ethiopia's folk music and performances, Indonesia's tropical
 scenic views, as well as interesting interactions with local people,
 all of which constitute an unforgettable memory in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
   Now I am a graduate student of Illinois Institute of Technology,
 majoring in Technical Communication and Information Design. This is
 my first individual website to share studies, works and life with you.
